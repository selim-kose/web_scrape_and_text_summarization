       " \"Thursday, November 30, 2017\\xa0 On Monday, Italian football club AC Milan sacked manager Vincenzo Montella. Gennaro Gatusso, manager of AC Milan's youth team, was named as Manetella's successor.\\n Monetella's team started this season with winning ten out of twelve fixtures in all competitions. However, in fourteen Italian Serie A league matches played so far, Monetella's men won just six matches, losing six and drawing two matches. Having spent £205 million in the summer transfer window, AC Milan has won just 20 points in Serie A. They are seventh in the league table, and eighteen points behind the league leaders SSC Napoli.\\n The Milanese club named Gatusso as their new manager. Gatusso played for Milan from 1999 till 2013. As a player, Gatusso has won two Serie A titles and two UEFA Champions League titles with AC Milan. Since 2013, AC Milan has not finished in the top three spots in the league table.\\n Milan has qualified for this year's UEFA Europa League's knockouut phase. Montella's last match for the Rossoneri ended in a 0–0 draw against Torino FC at home. Milan has not scored in the last four league matches at home.\\n \\n Have an opinion on this story?
